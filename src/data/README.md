# Note

`This is our mock data source, you should never need to change anything here.`

You don't need to care about these dummy data. They are used for demo and testing purpose only.  
I'm using NFT data because they are aviailable evertwhere and free to use. If you are not familiar with NFT, you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token).

We do not need any NFT knowledge to build this project. They are just one type of digital product selling in the shop.

Some useful concepts if you are still interested:

- Collection: A collection is a group of NFTs. For example, a collection of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs.
- Token: A token is a single NFT. For example, a single Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT.
